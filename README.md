# SHakeItUp
A robot that shake things and gess the content of the container.

Built during the 2026 robotic hackathon of Unaite x GoSIM.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jogarulfo/ShakeItUp.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
cd lespectrobot
uv pip install -e .[feetech] 
```

Use "feetech" for the SO101 and "damiao" for the OpenARM.

## Usage :

The goal is to have a sensor on the jaw that cna get vibration data and use it to guess the content of the container. The experience have been made with a dragonfly sensor, and all the acquisition with a DAQ Dewesoft. It use the openDAQ library so you are free to modify the acqusition code to match your own setup.

The main code of the acquisition is in the submodule lespectrobot/src/lerobot/robots in theirn the codeis ready to use fot the SO101 and the OpenARM ( for the BiopenArm, just replace whatever of the two OpenArm by a OpenFollowerDragonTacile Arm in the file bi_openarm_follower.py ).
